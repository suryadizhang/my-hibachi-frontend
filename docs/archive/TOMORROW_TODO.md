## 🚨 **IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG**

### **Problem: Servers won't start**
```powershell
# Kill any existing processes
taskkill /f /im node.exe
taskkill /f /im python.exe

# Check ports
netstat -an | findstr "3000"
netstat -an | findstr "8000"

# Restart fresh
Double-click start-project.bat
```

### **Problem: Admin panel won't load**

git checkout [commit-hash]  # Restore if needed
```
