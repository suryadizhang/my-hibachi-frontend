## 🚀 Recent Updates - June 30, 2025 (CONTINUED)

### CSS Minification Warnings - RESOLVED ✅

- ✅ **Admin Record Creation** - New admin records are created in users table
- ✅ **New Admin Authentication** - Created admins can login immediately (FIXED!)
- ✅ **Root Cause Resolved** - Updated authentication logic to check users table first

### Authentication Fix Applied
- **Issue**: Admin login only checked legacy `admins` table, not `users` table where new admins are created
- **Solution**: Updated `/api/booking/admin/login` endpoint to check `users` table first, then fall back to legacy `admins` table
- **Result**: Newly created admin accounts can authenticate immediately
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing legacy admin accounts still work

### Testing Results
- **Frontend Build:** ✅ Successful (216.02 KB main bundle)
- **Backend API Tests:** ✅ All endpoints return 200 status
- **Admin Creation API:** ✅ Creates records successfully AND authentication works
- **Admin Authentication:** ✅ New admins can login immediately after creation
- **Database Integrity:** ✅ All tables and relationships intact

### Current Status: FULLY RESOLVED ✅
The admin creation functionality is now completely working. Superadmins can create new admin accounts that can authenticate immediately. The authentication system properly checks both the current users table and legacy admins table for backward compatibility.

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Debug the `get_admin_user` function authentication logic - COMPLETED
2. ✅ Verify password hashing consistency between creation and verification - COMPLETED  
3. ✅ Test complete admin creation → authentication → admin panel access flow - COMPLETED
4. ✅ Document final resolution - COMPLETED

**Admin Creation Functionality: FULLY OPERATIONAL** 🎉
