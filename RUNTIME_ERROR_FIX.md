# Runtime Error Fix - CustomerInfoForm

## Issue Diagnosed
**Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`

**Location:** `CustomerInfoForm.useMemo[validationErrors]` in the modular booking system

**Root Cause:** The `CustomerInfoForm` component was trying to access `formData` from the booking context, but the context was providing `customerInfo` instead. When `customerInfo` was undefined or not properly initialized, the validation logic would fail when trying to access properties like `field.charAt(0)`.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Property Name Correction
**File:** `components/booking/CustomerInfoForm.jsx`

**Before:**
```jsx
const { 
  selectedDate,
  selectedTimeSlot,  // ❌ Wrong property name
  formData,          // ❌ Wrong property name
  error,
  actions
} = useBooking();
```

**After:**
```jsx
const { 
  selectedDate,
  selectedTime,      // ✅ Correct property name
  customerInfo,      // ✅ Correct property name
  error,
  actions
} = useBooking();

// Ensure customerInfo is defined with default values
const formData = customerInfo || {
  name: '',
  phone: '',
  email: '',
  address: '',
  city: '',
  zipcode: '',
  contactPreference: 'email'
};
```

### 2. Action Method Correction
**Before:**
```jsx
actions.updateFormData({ [field]: value });
```

**After:**
```jsx
actions.updateCustomerInfo({ [field]: value });
```

### 3. TimeSlotSelection Component Fix
**File:** `components/booking/TimeSlotSelection.jsx`

**Before:**
```jsx
const { 
  selectedTimeSlot,  // ❌ Wrong property name
  // ...
} = useBooking();
```

**After:**
```jsx
const { 
  selectedTime,      // ✅ Correct property name
  // ...
} = useBooking();
```

## Technical Details

### BookingContext State Structure
```jsx
const initialState = {
  selectedDate: null,
  selectedTime: '',           // ✅ Not selectedTimeSlot
  customerInfo: {            // ✅ Not formData
    name: '',
    phone: '',
    email: '',
    address: '',
    city: '',
    zipcode: '',
    contactPreference: 'email'
  },
  // ...
};
```

### Defense Against Undefined Values
The fix includes a defensive approach to handle cases where `customerInfo` might be undefined:

```jsx
const formData = customerInfo || {
  name: '',
  phone: '',
  email: '',
  address: '',
  city: '',
  zipcode: '',
  contactPreference: 'email'
};
```

This ensures that even if the context hasn't been properly initialized, the component will still render without throwing runtime errors.

## Validation
- ✅ Components compile without errors
- ✅ Property names match the BookingContext state structure
- ✅ Defensive programming prevents undefined access
- ✅ Test file confirms fix prevents the original error

## Files Modified
1. `components/booking/CustomerInfoForm.jsx` - Main fix for property names and undefined handling
2. `components/booking/TimeSlotSelection.jsx` - Property name correction
3. `test_booking_fix.js` - Test file to validate the fix (can be removed)

## Result
The runtime error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')` has been resolved. The modular booking system now properly handles cases where the booking context might not be fully initialized, preventing crashes and improving user experience.
