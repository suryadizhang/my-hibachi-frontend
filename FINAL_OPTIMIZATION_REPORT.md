## 🎨 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS IMPLEMENTED

### React Performance Techniques:
```jsx
// 1. Component Memoization
export default memo(ComponentName);

// 2. Expensive Calculation Memoization
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => 
  heavyCalculation(data), [data]
);

// 3. Stable Function References
const handleClick = useCallback((id) => {
  onAction(id);
}, [onAction]);

// 4. Conditional Rendering Optimization
const ConditionalComponent = memo(({ show, children }) => 
  show ? children : null
);
```

### Backend Performance Techniques:
```python
# 1. Route Modularization
router = APIRouter(prefix="/booking", tags=["booking"])

# 2. Dependency Injection
@router.get("/data")
def get_data(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    return optimized_query(db)

# 3. Background Task Processing
@router.post("/action")
async def action(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    background_tasks.add_task(async_operation)

# 4. Rate Limiting
@limiter.limit("5/minute")
def protected_endpoint():
    return {"status": "success"}
```

❌ Mixed responsibilities in single files
❌ Frequent unnecessary re-renders
❌ Difficult to test and maintain
❌ Slow performance with complex interactions
❌ Hard to scale and extend features
```

### After Modularization:
