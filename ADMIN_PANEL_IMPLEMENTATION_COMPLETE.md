### 🔧 Major Issues Fixed

#### 1. **Admin Authentication & Security** ✅

  - Added missing `is_active` column to admins table
  - Fixed admin login endpoint to check `is_active` status
  - Updated existing admin records to be active
- **Result**: Login now works properly with test_superadmin account

#### 2. **KPI Data Consistency** ✅
- **Problem**: "This Month" KPI showed 2, but monthly endpoint showed 1 booking
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed monthly KPI calculation to use same logic as monthly endpoint
  - Eliminated duplicate counting from overlapping weekly databases
  - Now uses proper date range filtering with specific weeks
- **Result**: KPI counts now match endpoint data (1 booking this month)

#### 3. **Waitlist KPI Card Functionality** ✅

- **Solution**:
  - Added `handleWaitlistClick` function

  - Fixed API call format (query params + JSON body)
  - Updated frontend to send required parameters
  - Added reason collection for deposit confirmation
- **Result**: Deposit confirmation now works properly

#### 5. **Upcoming Events Date Range** ✅
- **Problem**: "Upcoming Events (14 days)" showed 0 bookings
